I want to build a simple website in node.js that is connected to a sqlite database. 
The website consists of a simple frontend for a simple picture database. 
The functionality of the website should be as follows: upload a picture with a description, list all uploaded pictures (as thumbnails) with their descriptions, show a picture in full detail (with its description). Delete actions should be be possible from the list of pictures shown. When a picture is shown in full detail, it is also possible to update its description. 
Each database record consists of a picture description and picture, uploaded to the website by the user. Use a modern, attractive UI design. 
Make the color scheme and the buttons used easily customizable, and also responsive and flexible for different screen types and devices. 

You must follow the planning in PLANNING.md, and you must keep track of the tasks that you need to do described in TASK.md.
Always before starting a new task, first  read PLANNING.md and TASK.md first, so you knwo where you are and you know what to do.
After completion of each task, update PLANNING.md and update TASK.md, so you know which tasks you have completed already.
When starting initially, create a Changelog.md file.
For each change that you have completed, update the Changelog.md file.
