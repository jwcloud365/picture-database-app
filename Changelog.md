# Changelog

## 2025-06-20 - Image Upload Preview Enhancements

### Enhanced Upload Experience
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Fixed memory leaks in image preview functionality
  - Added proper `URL.revokeObjectURL()` cleanup for blob URLs
  - Cleanup occurs on file removal, form reset, and page unload
  - Prevents browser memory accumulation during upload sessions

- ✅ **Loading States**: Improved user feedback during preview generation
  - Added spinner animations while previews are loading
  - Asynchronous preview generation prevents UI blocking
  - Smooth fade-in animations when previews complete

- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for preview failures
  - Graceful handling of non-image files
  - Preview error states with informative messages
  - Fallback UI for failed preview generation

- ✅ **Enhanced CSS**: Improved visual experience
  - Added fadeInUp animations for preview cards
  - Enhanced hover states with smooth transitions
  - Better loading indicator styling

### Technical Details
**Before**: Memory leaks from uncleaned object URLs
```javascript
col.innerHTML = `<img src="${URL.createObjectURL(file)}" ...>`;
```

**After**: Proper memory management with cleanup
```javascript
const objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(file);
img.onload = () => loadingDiv.replaceWith(img);
img.onerror = () => {
    URL.revokeObjectURL(objectURL);
    showPreviewError(container, 'Failed to load preview');
};
```

### Issues Resolved
